re-find out how to make .a files and what exactly they are.   I am thinking the piscine videos

going to make an enum for every flag.   this will specify type for va_arg, and also for the function dbl pointer.

must figure out how many flags and what they do (wiki printf).

	-use char c for the final determinant char
		 -use thhis in ft_putstr_fd_prec to determine not to use padding.
